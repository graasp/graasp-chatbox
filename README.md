# Graasp Chatbox

## Using the example project

To develop this component without using the full Graasp, there is an example project under the `example` folder.

Assuming a local development environment, a `.env.local` file needs to be placed in `example/.env.local` with the
following content:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_HOST="http://localhost:3000"
```
